# All-Things-Movies-and-TV-App

-> Using the free OMDB API, I have developed the app using the Microsoft Power Platform - with Power Apps. To be free of any limitations under the OPS network, I utilized the Microsoft 365 Developer program to sign up for a free tenant, Power Platform environment and license.

-> Features:

● The app is housed within a solution and connected to a publicly hosted repo on Github.

● The app is mimic as much as possible the Ontario Design System for its look and feel. This includes the header, headings, labels, buttons, text fields, font size and type.

● The app is using a gallery control to display movie cards.

● For each ‘movie’ or ‘tv’ card in the gallery, the card displays the poster, title, year, genre, actors, and plot.

● When a card within the gallery control is clicked, a detailed view of the selected movie or tv title is displayed. You can see the additional information in this ‘detail’ view.

● The app is accessibility compliant to WCAG 2.0 Level AA (as much as the Power Platform will support out of the box).

● Authenticated users (those I have shared the app with) can search and add a new movie or tv series to the existing default list. The App will remember the user's additions and allow the user to remove the movie or tv series at a later date.
